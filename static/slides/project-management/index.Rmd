# Workspace

* Libraries with `library()`
* User-created objects
* Option to save image of current workspace
* Treat workspaces as disposable

---

![](/img/if-you-liked-it-you-should-have-saved-the-source-for-it.jpg)

---

# Save code, not workspace

* Enforces reproducibility
* Easy to regenerate on-demand
* Always save commands
* Always start R with a blank state
* Restart R often

---

# Bad approaches

```r
rm(list = ls())
```

* Good intent, but poor execution
* Only deletes user-created objects
* Enforces hidden dependencies on things you ran before `rm(list = ls())`

# How to store work

* Split work into projects
* **We already do this**
* But why?

---

# `setwd()`

```r
library(ggplot2)
setwd("/Users/bensoltoff/cuddly_broccoli/verbose_funicular/foofy/data")
df <- read.delim("raw_foofy_data.csv")
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
ggsave("../figs/foofy_scatterplot.png")
```

---

# Project-based workflow

* File system discipline
* Working directory intentionality
* File path discipline

--

## Rationale for workflow

* Ensures portability
* Reliable, polite behavior

---

# RStudio Projects

* `.Rproj`
* Opening projects
* Switching between projects

---

# Use safe filepaths

* Avoid `setwd()`
* Split work into projects
* Declare each folder as a project
* Use `here()`

---

# `here::here()`

```{r}
library(here)
here()
```

--

* Build a file path

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
here("static", "extras", "awesome.txt")
cat(readLines(here("static", "extras", "awesome.txt")))
```
    
--

* What if we change the working directory?

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
setwd(here("static"))
getwd()
cat(readLines(here("static", "extras", "awesome.txt")))
```

---

# How does it know?

* Is a file named `.here` present?
* Is this an RStudio Project?
* Is this a checkout from a version control system?

---

# Filepaths and R Markdown

```
data/
  scotus.csv
analysis/
  exploratory-analysis.Rmd
final-report.Rmd
scotus.Rproj
```

--

* `.Rmd` and assumption of working directory
* Run `read_csv("data/scotus.csv")`
* Run `read_csv(here("data", "scotus.csv"))`

---

# R startup procedures

* Customized startup
* `.Renviron`
* `.Rprofile`

---

# `.Renviron`

* Define sensitive information
* Set R specific environmental variables
* Does not use R code syntax
* `usethis::edit_r_environ()`

--

## Example `.Renviron`

```shell
R_HISTSIZE=100000
GITHUB_PAT=abc123
R_LIBS_USER=~/R/%p/%v
```

---

# `.Rprofile`

* R code to run when R starts up
* Runs after `.Renviron`
* Multiple `.Rprofile` files
    * Home directory (`~/.Rprofile`)
    * Each R Project folder
* `usethis::edit_r_profile()`

---

# Common items in `.Rprofile`

1. Set a default CRAN mirror
1. Write a welcome message
1. Customize their R prompt
1. Change options, screen width, numeric display
1. Store API keys/tokens that are necessary for only a single project

We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

abstract: Person re-identification is a critical security task for recognizing a person
  across spatially disjoint sensors. Previous work can be computationally intensive
  and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on
  a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical
  and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where
  high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining
  these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination,
  and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful
  for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks
  where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results
  on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration
  of the system will be available on our website.

## Overview

* Identify the importance of preprocessing data sets
* Introduce the `recipes` package for preprocessing data
* Practice preprocessing data for statistical modeling

## Before class

* Read [Preprocess your data](/notes/preprocess/)
* Read [Evaluate your model with resampling](/notes/resampling/)

This is not a math/stats class. In class we will **briefly** summarize how these methods work and spend the bulk of our time on estimating and interpreting these models. That said, you should have some understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of statistical learning methods prior to implementing them yourselves. See below for some recommended readings:

* Chapter 5 in [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7138-7)
* Chapters 2-3 in [*Hands-On Machine Learning with R*](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/)
* [*Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models*](http://www.feat.engineering/)

## Class materials

* [Preprocess your data](/notes/preprocess/)
* [Evaluate your model with resampling](/notes/resampling/)
* In-class exercises

### Additional readings

* [`caret`](https://topepo.github.io/caret/) 
* [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/)
* [*Tidy Modeling with R*](https://www.tmwr.org/) - a book-length introduction to tidy modeling in R. Still an early work-in-progress

## What you need to do after class

* [Complete the statistical learning homework](/homework/statistical-learning/)

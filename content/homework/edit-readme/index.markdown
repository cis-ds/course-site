# Overview

Due before class Thursday June 27th.

The goal is to test your software installation, our GitHub setup, and our homework submission process via pull request, as well as demonstrate competency in Markdown.

# Fork the `hw01` repository

Go [here](https://github.com/cfss-su19/hw01) to fork the repo.

# Edit `README.md`

When you create the repository, you will notice there is only one file in the repo: `README.md`. In future assignments, the repo will be seeded with additional files/data that are necessary to get started.

[Your general workflow](/faq/homework-guidelines/#homework-workflow) will be:

* Pull from GitHub (just an empty precaution now, but will matter when you collaborate with others)
* Make changes locally to `README.md` in RStudio
* Save your changes
* Commit your changes to your repo
* Push the commit to GitHub

## Practice using Markdown

Written assignments will be submitted using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Markdown is a lightweight text formatting language that easily converts between file formats. It is integrated directly into [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), which combines R code, output, and written text into a single document (`.Rmd`). Regular Markdown files (`.md`) are rendered on the GitHub website and can be directly read on the website. GitHub includes [a guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for writing Markdown documents.

Your `README.md` should contain a brief biography of yourself. To achieve full marks, you should include at least 4 of the following elements:

* Headers
* Emphasis (italics or bold)
* Lists
* Images^[Perhaps add a picture of yourself to your repo and embed it in your readme.]
* Links

# Report your process

Include a description of how you got the changes into `README.md` on GitHub when you submit your assignment via pull request. You're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.

# Submit the assignment

Follow instructions on [homework workflow](/faq/homework-guidelines/#homework-workflow).

# Rubric

Check minus: `README.md` says equivalent of "This is the repository of Benjamin Soltoff". All work done via browser at github.com ... but that's just a guess, because student doesn't actually say how it was done.

Check: something in between

Check plus: `README.md` provides a proper introduction of student to the class. It also demonstrates experimentation with 4 or more aspects of the Markdown syntax. Examples: section headers, links, bold, italic, bullet points, image embed, etc. The student describes how they got the changes into `README.md` and offers a few reflections on their GitHub workflow and their experience with Markdown.

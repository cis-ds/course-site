Unlike [raster image maps](/notes/raster-maps-with-ggmap/), vector maps require you to obtain [spatial data files](/notes/simple-features/) which contain detailed information necessary to draw all the components of a map (e.g. points, lines, polygons). Once you successfully import that data into R, `ggplot2` works with simple features data frames to easily generate geospatial visualizations using all the core elements and approaches of `ggplot()`.

## Import USA state boundaries

First we will import a spatial data file containing the boundaries of all 50 states in the United States[^territories] using `sf::st_read()`:

```{r import-usa}
usa <- here(
  "static", "data", "census_bureau",
  "cb_2013_us_state_20m", "cb_2013_us_state_20m.shp"
) %>%
  st_read()
```

## Draw the boundaries

`ggplot2` contains a geometric object specifically for simple feature objects called `geom_sf()`. This works reasonably well when you need to draw **polygons**, like our state boundaries. Support for simple features in `ggplot2` is under active development, so you may not find adequate support for plotting line or point features. To draw the map, we pass the simple features data frame as the `data` argument.

```{r geom-sf}
ggplot(data = usa) +
  geom_sf()
```

Because simple features data frames are standardized with the `geometry` column always containing information on the geographic coordinates of the features, we do not need to specify additional parameters for `aes()`. Notice a problem with the map above: it wastes a lot of space. This is caused by the presence of Alaska and Hawaii in the dataset. The Aleutian Islands cross the the 180th meridian, requiring the map to show the Eastern hemisphere. Likewise, Hawaii is substantially distant from the continental United States.

## Plot a subset of a map

One solution is to plot just the lower 48 states. That is, exclude Alaska and Hawaii, as well as DC and Puerto Rico.[^rights] Because simple features data frames contain one row per feature and in this example a feature is defined as a state, we can use `filter()` from `dplyr` to exclude these four states/territories.

```{r usa-subset}
usa_48 <- usa %>%
  filter(NAME %in% state.name) %>%
  filter(NAME != "Alaska", NAME != "Hawaii")
usa_48

ggplot(data = usa_48) +
  geom_sf()
```

Since the map is a `ggplot()` object, it can easily be modified like any other `ggplot()` graph. We could change the color of the map and the borders:

```{r usa-fill}
ggplot(data = usa_48) +
  geom_sf(fill = "palegreen", color = "black")
```

## `urbanmapr`

Rather than excluding them entirely, most maps of the United States place Alaska and Hawaii as **insets** to the south of California. Until recently, in R this was an extremely tedious task that required manually changing the latitude and longitude coordinates for these states to place them in the correct location. Fortunately several packages are now available that have already done the work for you. [`urbnmapr`](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/urbnmapr) includes the `get_urbn_map()` function which returns a simple features data frame which contains adjusted coordinates for Alaska and Hawaii to plot them with the mainland. It can be installed from GitHub using `remotes::install_github("UrbanInstitute/urbnmapr")`.

```{r urbnmapr}
library(urbnmapr)
states_sf <- get_urbn_map("states", sf = TRUE)

ggplot(data = states_sf) +
  geom_sf()
```

## Add data to the map

Region boundaries serve as the background in geospatial data visualization - so now we need to add data. Some types of geographic data (points and symbols) are overlaid on top of the boundaries, whereas other data (fill) are incorporated into the region layer itself.

## Points

Let's use our [crimes data from New York City](/notes/geoviz/raster-maps-with-ggmap/#import-crime-data). `crimes` is a data frame with each row representing a reported crime in the city. Specifically we will filter the data frame to only examine reported homicides.

```{r import-crimes, include = FALSE}
crimes <- here("static", "data", "nyc-crimes.csv") %>%
  read_csv()
```

```{r import-crimes-fake, eval = FALSE}
crimes <- here("data", "nyc-crimes.csv") %>%
  read_csv()
```

```{r chi-crimes, echo = TRUE}
crimes_homicide <- filter(.data = crimes, ofns_desc == "MURDER & NON-NEGL. MANSLAUGHTER")
crimes_homicide
```

Each crime has it's geographic location encoded through `latitude` and `longitude`. To draw these points on the map, basically we draw a scatterplot with `x = longitude` and `y = latitude`. In fact we could simply do that:

```{r scatter}
ggplot(
  data = crimes_homicide,
  mapping = aes(
    x = longitude,
    y = latitude
  )
) +
  geom_point()
```

Let's overlay it with the mapped boroughs:

```{r import-nyc-json}
nyc_json <- st_read(dsn = here("static", "data", "borough-boundaries.geojson"))
```

```{r nyc-crime}
ggplot(data = nyc_json) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_point(
    data = crimes_homicide,
    mapping = aes(
      x = longitude,
      y = latitude
    ),
    shape = 1
  )
```

Alternatively, we can use `st_as_sf()` to convert `crimes_homicide` to a simple features data frame.

```{r crimes-sf}
crimes_homicide_sf <- st_as_sf(x = crimes_homicide, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"))
st_crs(crimes_homicide_sf) <- 4326 # set the coordinate reference system
crimes_homicide_sf
```

`coords` tells `st_as_sf()` which columns contain the geographic coordinates of each airport. To graph the points on the map, we use a second `geom_sf()`

```{r crimes-sf-plot, echo = TRUE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nyc_json) +
  geom_sf(
    data = crimes_homicide_sf,
    shape = 1
  )
```

## Fill (choropleths)

**Choropleth maps** encode information by assigning shades of colors to defined areas on a map (e.g. countries, states, counties, zip codes). There are lots of ways to tweak and customize these graphs, which is generally a good idea because remember that color is one of the harder-to-decode channels.

We will continue to use the `usa_48` simple features data frame and draw a choropleth for the number of foreign-born individuals in each state. We get those files from the `census_bureau` folder. Let's also normalize our measure by the total population to get the rate of foreign-born individuals in the population:

```{r import-foreign}
fb_state <- read_csv(file = here("static", "data", "foreign-born.csv"))
fb_state
```

### Join the data

Now that we have our data, we want to draw it on the map. `fb_state` contains one row per state, as does `usa_48`. Since there is a one-to-one match between the data frames, we join the data frames together first, then use that single data frame to draw the map. This differs from the approach above for drawing points because a point feature is not the same thing as a polygon feature. That is, there were more airports then there were states. Because the spatial data is stored in a data frame with one row per state, all we need to do is merge the data frames together on a column that uniquely identifies each row in each data frame.

```{r usa-foreign-join}
usa_fb <- left_join(x = usa_48, y = fb_state, by = c("STATEFP" = "GEOID", "NAME"))
usa_fb
```

### Draw the map

With the newly combined data frame, use `geom_sf()` and define the `fill` aesthetic based on the column in `usa_fb` you want to visualize.

```{r geom-map-state}
ggplot(data = usa_fb) +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = pct_foreign))
```

### Bin data to discrete intervals

When creating a heatmap with a continuous variable, one must decide whether to keep the variable as continuous or collapse it into a series of bins with discrete colors. While keeping the variable continuous is technically more precise, [the human eye cannot usually distinguish between two colors which are very similar to one another.](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/heatmaps_to_bin_or_not.pdf) By converting the variable to a discrete variable, you easily distinguish between the different levels. If you decide to convert a continuous variable to a discrete variable, you will need to decide how to do this. While `cut()` is a base R function for converting continuous variables into discrete values, `ggplot2` offers two functions that explicitly define how we want to bin the numeric vector (column).

`cut_interval()` makes `n` groups with equal range:

```{r cut-interval}
usa_fb %>%
  mutate(rate_cut = cut_interval(rate, n = 6)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = rate_cut))
```

Whereas `cut_number()` makes `n` groups with (approximately) equal numbers of observations:

```{r cut-number}
usa_fb %>%
  mutate(rate_cut = cut_number(rate, n = 6)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = rate_cut))
```

## Changing map projection

{{< youtube vVX-PrBRtTY >}}

{{< figure src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/mercator_projection.png" caption="[Mercator Projection](https://xkcd.com/2082/)" >}}

Representing portions of the globe on a flat surface can be challenging. Depending on how you project the map, you can distort or emphasize certain features of the map. Fortunately, `ggplot()` includes the `coord_sf()` function which allows us to easily implement different projection methods. In order to implement coordinate transformations, you need to know the **coordinate reference system** that defines the projection method. The "easiest" approach is to provide what is known as the `proj4string` that defines the projection method. [PROJ4](https://proj4.org/) is a generic coordinate transformation software that allows you to convert between projection methods. If you get really into geospatial analysis and visualization, it is helpful to learn this system.

For our purposes here, `proj4string` is a character string in R that defines the coordinate system and includes parameters specific to a given coordinate transformation. PROJ4 includes [some documentation on common projection methods](https://proj4.org/operations/projections/index.html) that can get you started. Some projection methods are relatively simple and require just the name of the projection, like for a [Mercator projection](https://proj4.org/operations/projections/merc.html) (`"+proj=merc"`):

```{r projections}
map_proj_base <- ggplot(data = usa_48) +
  geom_sf()
```

```{r mercator}
map_proj_base +
  coord_sf(crs = "+proj=merc") +
  ggtitle("Mercator projection")
```

Other coordinate systems require specification of the **standard lines**, or lines that define areas of the surface of the map that are tangent to the globe. These include [Gall-Peters](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/gall-peters-orthographic-projection/proj4/), [Albers equal-area](https://proj4.org/operations/projections/aea.html), and [Lambert azimuthal](https://proj4.org/operations/projections/laea.html).

```{r projection-rest}
map_proj_base +
  coord_sf(crs = "+proj=cea +lon_0=0 +lat_ts=45") +
  ggtitle("Gall-Peters projection")

map_proj_base +
  coord_sf(crs = "+proj=aea +lat_1=25 +lat_2=50 +lon_0=-100") +
  ggtitle("Albers equal-area projection")

map_proj_base +
  coord_sf(crs = "+proj=laea +lat_0=35 +lon_0=-100") +
  ggtitle("Lambert azimuthal projection")
```

## Session Info

```

[^territories]: Plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
[^rights]: Issues of political sovereignty aside, these entities are frequently excluded from maps depending on the data to be incorporated. You can always choose to leave them in the map.

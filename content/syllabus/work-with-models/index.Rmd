## Overview

* Combine multiple `ggplot()` objects using `patchwork`
* Fit multiple regression lines as separate layers in `ggplot()`
* Generate legends using single-value variables
* Identify principles for visualizing statistical model estimates
* Generate predicted values from models for graphing
* Plot marginal effects using `margins`

## Before class

* Read [Work with Models in *Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction*](https://socviz.co/modeling.html)
* Install the following packages:

    ```r
    install.packages(c("socviz", "margins"))
    remotes::install_github("thomasp85/patchwork")
    ```

## Overview

* Define *exploratory data analysis* (EDA) and types of pattern exploration
* Demonstrate types of graphs useful for EDA and precautions when interpreting them
* Practice exploring data

## Before class

* Read Chapters 7-8 from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## Class materials

* [Exploratory data analysis](/notes/exploratory-data-analysis/)
* [Practice exploring college education (data)](/notes/exploratory-data-analysis-practice/)

## Additional resources

* [Graphical Data Analysis with R](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/15122517) - Antony Unwin. Great coverage of a range of graphical methods for data exploration and analysis. Also draws on packages beyond `ggplot2` for statistical graphics.

### Cheat sheets

* [Data visualization with ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf)

## What you need to do after class

* [Complete the exploring and visualizing data homework](/homework/explore-data/)

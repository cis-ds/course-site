## Overview

* Review the major types of vectors
* Demonstrate how to subset vectors
* Demonstrate vector recycling
* Define lists
* Demonstrate iterative operations using loops, `map()` functions, and `dplyr::across()`
* Practice writing iterative operations using loops, `map()` functions, and `dplyr::across()`

## Before class

* Read chapters 14.1-2, 20-21 from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## Class materials

* [Data storage types](/notes/vectors/)
* [Iteration](/notes/iteration/)
* [Column-wise operations](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/colwise.html)

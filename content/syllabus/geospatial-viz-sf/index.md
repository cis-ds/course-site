## Overview

* Define shapefiles and import spatial data using the `sf` package
* Draw maps using `ggplot2` and `geom_sf()`
* Change coordinate systems
* Generate appropriate color palettes to visualize additional dimensions of data

## Before class

* Read [Importing shapefiles using `sf`](/notes/simple-features/)
* Read [Drawing vector maps with `ggplot2` and `sf`](/notes/vector-maps/)

## Class materials

* [Selecting optimal color palettes](/notes/optimal-color-palettes/)
* [Practice drawing vector maps](/notes/vector-maps-practice/)

* [Mapping data in *The Truthful Art* by Alberto Cairo](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/15104586) - excellent chapter on designing data maps with lots of examples. Though really the entire book is useful if you do a lot of work with data visualizations of any type.

## What you need to do after class
